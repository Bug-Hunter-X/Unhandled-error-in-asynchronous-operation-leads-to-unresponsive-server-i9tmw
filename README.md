# Unhandled Error in Asynchronous Node.js Operation

This repository demonstrates a common error in Node.js server development: improper error handling in asynchronous operations that can lead to unresponsive connections.  The example showcases a scenario where an asynchronous function might fail but the error isn't handled correctly, causing the server to hang on requests.

The `bug.js` file demonstrates the problematic code. The solution in `bugSolution.js` provides a proper way to handle these errors by ensuring the response is ended, even if an error occurs.

## How to reproduce the bug

1.  Run `bug.js`.
2.  Send several requests to the server (e.g., using `curl`). You'll observe that some requests may hang and never receive a response.

## How to fix the bug

The solution file `bugSolution.js` demonstrates how to correctly handle errors. By using a `finally` block or ensuring that `res.end()` is called in both success and failure scenarios, the issue is resolved.
